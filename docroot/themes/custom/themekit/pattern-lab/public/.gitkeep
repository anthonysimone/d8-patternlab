This is the directory pattern lab dist will be published to. We are ignoring it because most files change
on each generation because of cache busting and are instead committing a `published` directory so we can
commit the patternlab to the repo when we choose. This directory needs to exist in the repo for you to compile pattern
lab for the first time.
